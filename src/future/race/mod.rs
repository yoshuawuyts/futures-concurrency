    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// Await multiple futures until the first resolve.
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
    /// use futures_concurrency::prelude::*;
    ///
    /// async fn fast_and_err(id: u8) -> Result<u8, u8> {
    ///     futures_lite::future::yield_now().await;
    ///     Err(id)
    /// }
    /// async fn slow_and_ok(id: u8) -> Result<u8, u8> {
    ///     futures_lite::future::yield_now().await;
    ///     Ok(id)

    /// assert_eq!(id, Err(1));

    /// ## Translating from `select!`
    ///
    /// The following example is taken from the [`futures::select!`] documentation:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
    /// use futures::future;
    /// use futures::select;
    /// let mut a = future::ready(4);
    /// let mut b = future::pending::<()>();
    ///
    /// let res = select! {
    ///     a_res = a => a_res + 1,
    ///     _ = b => 0,
    /// };
    /// assert_eq!(res, 5);
    /// # });
    /// ```
    ///
    /// and can be translated using `race` as:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
    /// use futures::future;
    /// use futures::select;
    /// use futures_concurrency::prelude::*;
    ///
    /// let mut a = async {
    ///     let a_res = future::ready(4).await;
    ///     a_res + 1
    /// };
    /// let mut b = async {
    ///     let _ = future::pending::<()>().await;
    ///     0
    /// };
    ///
    /// let res = (a, b).race().await;
    ///
    /// assert_eq!(res, 5);
    /// # });
    /// ```
    ///
    /// <br><br>
    /// This function returns a new future which polls all futures concurrently.
