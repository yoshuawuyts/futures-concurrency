    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// Awaiting multiple futures of the same type can be done using either a vector
    /// or an array.
    /// ```rust
    /// #  futures::executor::block_on(async {
    /// use futures_concurrency::prelude::*;
    ///
    /// // all futures passed here are of the same type
    /// let fut1 = core::future::ready(1);
    /// let fut2 = core::future::ready(2);
    /// let fut3 = core::future::ready(3);
    ///
    /// let outputs = [fut1, fut2, fut3].join().await;
    /// assert_eq!(outputs, [1, 2, 3]);
    /// # })
    /// ```
    ///
    /// In practice however, it's common to want to await multiple futures of
    /// different types. For example if you have two different `async {}` blocks,
    /// you want to `.await`. To do that, you can call `.join` on tuples of futures.
    /// ```rust
    /// #  futures::executor::block_on(async {
    /// use futures_concurrency::prelude::*;
    ///
    /// async fn some_async_fn() -> usize { 3 }
    ///
    /// // the futures passed here are of different types
    /// let fut1 = core::future::ready(1);
    /// let fut2 = async { 2 };
    /// let fut3 = some_async_fn();
    /// //                       ^ NOTE: no `.await` here!
    ///
    /// let outputs = (fut1, fut2, fut3).join().await;
    /// assert_eq!(outputs, (1, 2, 3));
    /// # })
    /// ```
    ///
    /// <br><br>
    /// This function returns a new future which polls all futures concurrently.
