//! Concurrency extensions for [`Future`][core::future::Future] and `Stream`
//! (also known as [`AsyncIterator`][core::async_iter::AsyncIterator]).
//!
//! Companion library for the "Futures Concurrency" blog post
//! series:
//! - [Futures Concurrency I: Introduction](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/futures-concurrency/)
//! - [Futures Concurrency II: A Trait Approach](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/futures-concurrency-2/)
//! - [Futures Concurrency III: `select!`](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/futures-concurrency-3/)
//! - [Futures Concurrency IV: Join Semantics](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/futures-concurrency-4/)
//!
//! The purpose of this library is to serve as a staging ground for what
//! eventually may become the futures concurrency methods provided by the
//! stdlib. See the [`future`] and [`stream`] submodules for more.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! Because of orphan rules this library can't implement everything the stdlib
//! can. The missing implementations are:
//!
//! - `impl<T> IntoFuture for Vec<T>`
//! - `impl<T, const N: usize> IntoFuture for [T; N]`
//! - `impl<T..> IntoFuture for (T..)`
//! - `impl<T> IntoAsyncIterator for Vec<T>`
//! - `impl<T, const N: usize> IntoAsyncIterator for [T; N]`
//! - `impl<T..> IntoAsyncIterator for (T..)`
//!
//! This would enable containers of futures to directly be `.await`ed to get
//! `merge` semantics. Or containers of async iterators to be passed directly to
//! `for..await in` loops to be iterated over using `merge` semantics. This would
//! remove the need to think of "merge" as a verb, and would enable treating
//! sets of futures concurrently.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Concurrently await multiple heterogenous futures:
//! ```rust
//! use futures_concurrency::prelude::*;
//! use futures_lite::future::block_on;
//! use std::future;
//!
//! block_on(async {
//!     let a = future::ready(1u8);
//!     let b = future::ready("hello");
//!     let c = future::ready(3u16);
//!     assert_eq!((a, b, c).join().await, (1, "hello", 3));
//! })
//! ```
